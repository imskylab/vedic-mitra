## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Nothing yet.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added
- **Phase 1 — repository foundation.**
  - Gradle (Kotlin DSL) build with a centralized version catalog and `build-logic/` convention
    plugins (`vedicmitra.android.application/library/compose/hilt/feature`, `vedicmitra.kotlin.library`).
  - Modular, feature-first Clean Architecture skeleton: `:app`; `:core:common`, `:core:ui`,
    `:core:designsystem`, `:core:astronomy`, `:core:scheduler`, `:core:notifications`,
    `:core:location`; `:feature:home`, `:feature:settings`, `:feature:alarm`.
  - Hilt DI scaffolding (application root, `@HiltViewModel` skeletons) and a Material 3 design
    system (`VedicMitraTheme`) with light/dark and dynamic colour.
  - Contract-only ports for astronomy, scheduler, notifications, and location (no implementations).
  - Quality tooling: Detekt, Spotless, Ktlint, and a shared `.editorconfig`.
  - GitHub Actions CI (Android SDK setup → Spotless → Detekt → unit tests → assemble APK, APK +
    test-report artifacts), a tag-triggered Release workflow that publishes an installable APK,
    Dependabot, and issue/PR templates.
  - IDE-optional workflow: VS Code settings, recommended extensions, and build tasks
    (`.vscode/tasks.json`) so the app builds without Android Studio.
  - Documentation: README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, AGENTS.md, and `docs/` (architecture,
    getting started incl. Android-Studio-free setup, module guide, ADRs).
  - Gradle 8.14 wrapper.

### Notes
- Business logic, astronomy calculations, and alarm behaviour are intentionally **not** included in
  this release — see the roadmap in the README.
